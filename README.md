# OBJ Rigger

This is a one-off project to help Sea Power modders deal with rigging their mod's models. 

## Usage

1) Run the exe
2) Select the file you want to move
3) Select the reference file
4) Copy relevant parts of output.txt into your craft.ini
5) Debug it in Sea Power

This tool isn't perfect, but it will hopefully save you a decent amount of time.

## Professionalism
None.  

I'm treating this project like I would a one-off personal project for now, so my commits will be badly named and SemVer nonexistent. I will also be very tounge-in-cheek with any text files on this repo.
